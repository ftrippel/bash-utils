bash-utils
==========

Some bash utility functions.

Just to get things straight, I am not a fan of bash scripts and I would resort to anything more high-level like Java or Python for doing something complex. However, there are some applications (and constraints) for which bash scripts are more suited.

For instance, for my diploma thesis I had to run some R program in parallel. I could have done this in R itself as there are numerous packages for that, but I wanted to run the program on univeristy computers and I cannot just install an R package  there. That is why I wrote a little bash process management script.

# Idioms

For the sake of documentation (as I am quite forgetful) and for sharing with bash novices, I am going to jot down some bash idioms that proved quite useful.
